# AI Playground
Developed with Unreal Engine 5

Open Sourced :3

Helloo! Welcome to **AIPlayground**. AIPlayground is a sandbox Game where developers (Or non developers) can create or "Improve" AI's' As previously stated This is using "Unreal Engine 5.1" and requires a few plugins.
Here's a list of plugins that are needed to run the Project.
1.Perception Extension(https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/perception-extension)
Yeah.. That's it lol, This project is supposed to be light on plugins and marketplace items, Atleast programming wise.

  Now the moment you've been waiting for the.. **Commit Rules**

1.Try not to add too much marketplace stuff, especially One's that bring lots of **assets**, also try to use the free one's since we have to respect our fellow developers who worked hard to make those.
2.When Making a New Entity please put it in the "/Blueprints/AI/"Your Entity Name"/" this is to add easy navigation for other developers to look and constructively criticize your work before it gets added to the main project.
3.Try not to add anything to.. Overpowered, what I mean by this is entities that can destroy any other entity easily just by looking at them or something. as long as it's not something like SCP-001 When Day breaks. or The Scarlet King, you'll be fine
4.When adding an entity, let's say SCP-173 and someone else makes an Entity called SCP-173 and they function idenetically. **The one with more legible, optimized and easier to add onto**, will be chosen to get added to the main branch.
5.When adding or changing a entity. let's take for instance. The Warden, please be sure to document your changes in a clear, Specific and organized fashion. If you say something like "Updated Warden's aggro behavior" your changes will be rejected.
6.Lastly when moving asset locations please say where you moved it.

**That's It, Hopefully you all enjoy this project as much as I do, Cheers!**
